     Lizz's Lizard Lounge kicked off the ground on March 10th, 2017. This is the day after her fiance's birthday and she had the day off of work so she thought, what the heck, I'll open a psychadelic lizard restaurant. That same day she went out and aquired the friendliest and most colorful lizards across the globe as a way to bring cheer and comfort to her customers while they stuff their faces.These friendly little guys will sit upon their shoulders their entire stay and by the end of the night they shall be the best of friends to the lounge's guests. </p>
